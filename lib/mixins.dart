 * In order to get rid of overriding and using super to take functionality of the parent and use it in our code we can either use mixins { which is similar to interfaces in java } and call them using keyword 'with'
 
 Problem: we can only have single inheritence
 Sol. we can have multiple mixins to be used inside a class
 Aim: We can incorporate a lot of code written in a class and use in different classes without having to do inheritence
